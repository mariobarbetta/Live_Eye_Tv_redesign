            >, as well as how the band came together, their creative process,
            and making music in the digital age. Featuring
            <b>Correia-Damude</b>, as well as the musicians <b>Mike Lobel</b>,
            <b>Antonio Naranjo</b>, and <b>Will Culbert</b>, the Toronto-based
            four-piece cemented their direction during an artistic residency at
            the Banff Arts Centre. Formerly called Boys Who Say No, their work
            during the residency with producers like <b>Kevin Drew</b>,
            <b>Charles Spearin</b> and <b>Shawn Everett</b> allowed the band to
            expand in new directions resulting in their 2016 self-titled LP.
          </p>
          <p>
            This week <b>Future Peers</b> return with their new 6-song EP
            <i>“I’m Sorry.”</i> Recorded by producer/engineer
            <b>Tom McFall</b> (Stars, Bloc Party, Regina Spector), who flew to
            Canada to work with the band, the album continues their foray into
            experimental pop with even more attention placed on the intricacies
            of arrangement and vocal production. Describing their sound as
            “dance-pop meets art-rock in a demolition derby,”
            <i>“I’m Sorry”</i> features an energetic sound that combines
            danceable beats and infectious hooks with anthemic choruses. This
            week Correia-Damude took time to discuss the band and EP via email.
            Below, you can read a transcript of the proceedings, as well as
            watch videos for EP standouts like <i>“Madonna Trash”</i> and
            <i>“Didn’t I Deny.”</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>LETV:</b> Hello Future Peers. Thanks for taking the time to
            answer some questions about the band and your upcoming EP
            <i>“I’m Sorry.”</i> Before we delve into the upcoming record, let's
            cover a little background about the group. If I understand
            correctly, it looks like things really got going for you guys after
            an artistic residency at the Banff Arts Centre though you guys were
            part of a band called Boys Who Say No before that. Can you tell us a
            little bit about how the band came together in the early days and
            how your residency at the Arts Center, as well as your time in LA
            working with Shawn Everett, helped cement your new direction?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Luke Correia-Damude:</b> Boys Who Say No was a project we started
            in our early 20's. It was so much fun and it allowed us to travel a
            lot and form a tight musical bond. We had a pretty good following
            and toured internationally. All of the members of
            <b>Future Peers</b> were, at some point, members of Boys Who Say No.
            We knew that we loved making music together but the group
            consciousness was starting to shift in sentimentality and sonic
            palette. We started making more weird stuff that was simultaneously
            pretty poppy. The band was diving deep into mixing in synths and
            playing with interesting orchestration. We all felt that it was time
            for a major change.
          </p>
          <p>
            This feeling of want coincided with an invitation to attend the
            <b>Indie Music Residency</b> at the Banff Arts Centre. We had been
            selected by Canadian music heavyweights <b>Kevin Drew</b> and
            <b>Charles Spearin</b> to participate in this amazing program. The
            residency was a real awakening for us as a band. It gave us the time
            and resources to stretch our legs and explore what this new sound we
            were tooling around with could really be. Producer/Engineer
            <b>Shawn Everett</b> (Alabama Shakes, War On Drugs, Julian
            Casablancas) was brought in to work with us during the residency. I
            remember him and Kevin coming into our rehearsal space the night
            before our first session with them. We played them the song we were
            thinking of working on and Shawn was really stoked on it. He said,
            <i>"Woah, you guys are actually really good."</i> We took that as a
            compliment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our sessions with Shawn and Kevin were really exciting and the
            energy in the room was super positive. We did some really great work
            with them, and, as a result, Shawn invited us to record with him in
            L.A. at his studio. I would say that it was this time out in
            California that truly realized what we were trying to achieve with
            this new project and allowed us to emerge as <b>Future Peers</b>. We
            spent many months out in LA working with Shawn and fitting into his
            busy schedule. It was a really inspiring experience. Shawn is a
            genius and he takes his craft very seriously. He is adventurous and
            driven. This coupled with his immense skill is a magic combination.
            We decided to put our old name to rest and emerge as a new project
            and that is how <b>Future Peers</b> was born. The group felt that
            the music we had recorded with Shawn and Kevin was too special to be
            released as a third album from a mildly successful Canadian band. We
            wanted to offer up this new sound and these new tracks as a fresh
            idea and a new opportunity for us to play/create music for people.

          <p>
            <b>LETV:</b> On November 2nd you guys will release a new 6-track EP
            called <i>"I'm Sorry"</i>. What can you tell us about the recording
            process for the upcoming record? For instance, did you return to
            work with producers like Kevin Drew and Hal Wilner, or Shawn
            Everett?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Luke Correia-Damude:</b> <i>“I’m Sorry”</i> began immediately
            after releasing our last album. We were so incredibly inspired by
            our mentor/producers Kevin, Hal and Shawn that we wrote feverishly
            for months and sketched probably 15 pieces. We then narrowed that
            down to a few that really excited us. One day, kind of magically,
            our phone rang, and the person on the other end was someone who,
            from across the pond, had heard what we were doing and wanted to
            throw down with us. That person, turns out, was producer/engineer
            Tom McFall (Stars, Bloc Party, Regina Spector). So Tom flew across
            the ocean to realize these songs with us–it was a beautiful thing.
            Some of the bed tracks had been done in a cottage in the countryside
            that we’ve grown fond of recording in. The rest were recorded at our
            studio in Toronto–Copper Sound Studio in Guelph–and some of it was
            even recorded in a bedroom. Tom is such a fun and funny gentleman,
            we immediately clicked. He also has a really precise ear and we
            learned a lot about the intricacies of his process especially when
            it comes to arrangement and vocal production. This album puts the
            vocals way up front, which is a bit of a new thing for us, and I
            think we wouldn’t have felt so comfortable doing that without Tom.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>LETV:</b> I'm curious to know a little bit more about the band's
            creative process as far as writing music goes. You guys have such a
            unique and eclectic sound that blends elements of dance music and
            art rock. Is there a track on the new EP that might be emblematic of
            your process and allow us to peek behind the scenes as far as
            writing and composing goes?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Luke Correia-Damude:</b> We write collaboratively so most of the
            work is done together in our studio on the west end of Toronto.
            Often our songs blossom out of a jam or a little idea we have in the
            room. Sometimes one of us will bring in a nugget and share the idea
            with the band and that triggers the direction for the song. I
            generally treat the vocals as a tonal instrument at first. I am less
            concerned with words and lyrics when we are creating something.
            Usually, the vocal melodies begin without words attached. A sort of
            melodic free association mixed with mumblings. Once the structure
            and frame of the song are set then I will focus in on writing lyrics
            and words. A lot of times I find words and phrases I would have
            never thought of through listening back to the mumblings I sing in
            reference recordings. I think what is special about our musical
            relationship is that we all bring our own style and inspirations to
            the table. Mike was a real Industrial kid, Antonio loves ballads and
            more soulful songs, Will is our Prog-Rock aficionado, and I started
            as an acoustic singer/songwriter who was obsessed with the likes of
            Elvis Costello and Soundgarden. It's a real confluence of influences
            that manifest themselves in a pretty distinct sound.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>LETV:</b> This year the band returned to play a show at 587A
            College St. in Toronto, the site of the old Whippersnapper, an art
            gallery/venue that you started back in the early 2000's. Sounds like
            it was quite the place and that it hosted some very cool music shows
            back in the day. While those were very different times for indie
            music and the arts, is it fair to say the spirit of what the old
            Whippersnapper was trying to accomplish still lives on to this day
            in what the band is about?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Luke Correia-Damude:</b> I learned a lot building Whippersnapper.
            I think that starting and running Whippersnapper was one of the most
            significant character building and educational things I've ever
            done. We have surely torn a page from the book of that old place. It
            was a really exciting time for music in the city and it was
            thrilling to be so connected to the art and music scene. I think
            what we draw on most from the Whippersnapper days is the knowledge
            that putting in the work and offering something up can be rewarded.
            When we perform or record music we really give it our all and we
            inject that amount of effort into this so that people can absorb it.
            Whippersnapper was a really hard thing to pull off and it took an
            amazing amount of work to get off the ground but once it was open
            the community really embraced it. The space became a real hub and
            earned a loyal following. People knew that we were out there
            curating interesting and fun things so they would return again and
            again.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is what we hope to achieve with our music. We want people to
            enjoy themselves and know that when they come to see us or when they
            listen to our music they are receiving an offering from us. This
            contract between the audience and the performer is important to
            continually live up to. We want people to know that when they see
            FUTURE PEERS they are going to have a blast and see a bunch of
            people working hard to deliver something genuine to them.
            Whippersnapper hosted a lot of amazing artists like Ariel Pink,
            Future Islands, Matt and Kim and Ian Mckay to name a few. It was
            really a pleasure to be a young person surrounded by these amazing
            artists and musicians. It makes you respect the craft a lot and it
            really made me understand that making art is dedication and
            diligence.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>LETV:</b> Continuing on that topic, how has the music scene in
            Toronto changed thru the years and how does the band navigate the
            current climate in the wake of those changes? For instance, your
            music seems to embrace both dance culture and art rock. Is that a
            reflection of the climate change or a representation of the band's
            interest thru the years?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Luke Correia-Damude:</b> When we talk about a city the size of
            Toronto, it’s best to think in terms of music scenes. As in plural.
            This city has some of the best bands, in any genre, a music lover
            could hope for. Always has. That said, the major change in recent
            years has been the loss of so many great music venues to the condo
            culture. Bands are now having to get very creative in terms of
            finding spaces to perform in. Speaking to the blend of art rock and
            dance-pop influences that you’ve picked up on in our sound, we’re
            only doing what comes naturally to us as a group. We write all of
            our music collectively, and I don’t think we’ve ever set out to
            write a dance hit, or rock anthem, or whatever. We just write the
            songs that we’d like to hear. I think it is fair to say that we do
            love dancing and having a good time so that definitely bleeds into
            our songs.

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Luke Correia-Damude:</b> Well, first and foremost, our producers.
            Shawn Everett on the first album and Tom McFall on the new EP. Both
            of these guys felt like the fifth member of the group during the
            recording sessions and, as such, we trusted both of them completely
            to co-pilot the musical vision of the band. As our name suggests,
            it’s a vision of a future that peers backwards into the present.
            It’s been said that the current era contains all the cultural tropes
            of history, existing simultaneously. What would a future that looks
            back on this current era with nostalgia and reverence look and sound
            like? That’s our starting point. When we play these songs for people
            we are performing and it seems that the performative element seems
            to get lost in a lot of live music engagements these days. We like
            dressing up, moving our bodies and making an impact on the audience.
            When people work at an office they put on a suit. When we play a
            dazzling, high energy gig we dress accordingly.

            <b>LETV:</b> While so much has changed in the music business over
            the last twenty years, in your experience as a band, have things
            like social media and platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music,
            Bandcamp, Soundcloud, and YouTube made it easier for groups to find
            success, or is the reality more of an empty promise?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Luke Correia-Damude:</b> I don’t think many people really
            understand the music business, even the music business doesn’t
            understand the music business. The rise of digital platforms and
            social media blindsided everyone except the early adopters and now
            we’re all trying to figure it out. The future of music turned out to
            be totally different then it was in the Grunge era when we were
            coming of age. That’s where we grew up. MTV was the big conglomerate
            promoting the biggest acts, the top 1% of music if you will and
            going to your local record shop or your friends’ house was where you
            went to discover new music, the stuff they didn’t play on the radio.
            That’s really informed our musical sensibilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are obvious benefits to this digital sharing renaissance, like
            the democratization of art and the ease in which you can own it.
            That’s the gift the internet gave us, but, like anything truly open
            and free, it’s only a matter of time before companies learn how to
            tilt the table towards themselves. On the other hand, we have fans
            in other parts of the world that likely wouldn’t know we existed if
            we were back in the MTV era. And we can all go back and forth
            between these two positions all day long, because it’s a difficult
            and dense conversation, and, learning to live comfortably in the
            grey is probably well advised #FuturePeers. All we ask is that if
            you really like an artist and you steam their music all the time
            take a moment to buy their music online. Even better, go see their
            show when they come through town and buy a record out of their
            sweaty hands.

            <b>LETV:</b> Last month you guys released a really awesome video for
            the track <i>Didn't I Deny</i> directed by Ryan Thompson. Looks like
            it was quite the production! In addition, you have a new video for
            <i>Madonna Trash</i> directed by Bill Allinson and Andy Friesen. How
            did those videos come together and how important is video production
            to the band's aesthetic?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Luke Correia-Damude:</b> We have found that music videos have
            been really important for fleshing out our aesthetic on a whole.
            These videos breath new life into the songs. It is a way to have the
            music live in a different medium and you can gain perspective on the
            music you write by collaborating with filmmakers and artists. Their
            take on your work can be really refreshing and insightful. It also
            feels really good to work with artists in different mediums. We have
            formed a real bond with Ryan Thompson and we look forward to working
            with him again on our next project. Similarly, we have had Andy make
            two music videos for us and both have been incredible. I love
            expanding our community and working with people on creative
            projects. There is a real mutual respect and admiration that occurs
            when you work alongside great people. Mike and I both work in film
            production so it is a passion that we share with the directors of
            these videos.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>LETV:</b> Thanks for taking some time to answer questions about
            the band and your upcoming release! I'm sure you guys must be pretty
            excited to be putting out <i>I'm Sorry</i>. What kind of plans do
            you guys have for wrapping up 2018 and celebrating the EP's release?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Luke Correia-Damude:</b> We are really excited to let this dove
            fly free! It's always a relief to release something you've been
            working on for a while. We've done a little tour surrounding the
            release including Halifax, Fredricton, Montreal, Guelph, Sarnia, and
            Toronto. We play our hometown release on November 8th in Toronto at
            Sneaky Dees. This was one of the hot venues back in the early 2000s
            so we thought it would be a really fun throwback. After the release,
            we are going to focus on some writing and gear up for our first
            European tour in the spring of 2019. This is a real bucket list type
            thing for us. I can't wait to travel around Europe playing music for
            people!
