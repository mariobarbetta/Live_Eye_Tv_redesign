          <p>
            Belgian guitarist/vocalist <b>Thomas Werbrouck</b> (Little Trouble
            Kids) has a brand new project called
            <a href="http://krankland.be/" target="_blank">KRANKLAND</a>, and
            this month the band released their debut LP, <i>Wanderrooms</i>.
            Live Eye Tv had a chance to correspond with the musician regarding
            the new project and record, and he gave us an in-depth look at
            putting together the group, as well as their writing and recording
            process. It’s a fascinating conversation that explores the
            intersection between art and music, as well as the interaction
            between the conscious and unconscious in the creative process…
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>LETV:</b> Hi Thomas, thanks for taking time to answer some
            questions about your new project KRANKLAND and the band’s upcoming
            debut album, Wanderrooms. When we first met back in 2014, you were
            promoting your project with Eline Adam, <b>Little Trouble Kids</b>.
            I’m curious when you began working on <b>KRANKLAND</b>
            and the songs for your upcoming album. Is it true it began as a solo
            venture?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>TW:</b> I have been writing songs since, well, forever actually.
            But, as of 2015, I was writing more and more songs that didn’t fit
            the haunted-neurotic vibe of Little Trouble Kids. So, I wanted to
            explore a whole other artistic side of myself with KRANKLAND.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was clear these songs deserved a different moniker, but I wanted
            to separate it from my own persona: no one is interested in stories
            about me and my pygmy rabbit, So I invited a bunch of extremely
            talented musicians to join me in the studio: drummer
            <b>Christophe Claeys</b>, formerly of Balthazar, now with Amatorski,
            SX, Magnus, Thomas Mortier on bass and sound wizard Janko Beckers as
            my ersatz Warren Ellis. Together, we tackled my bedroom demos over a
            course of ten days. We went into the studio with an open visor–I'm
            always a big fan of serendipity. I love the story of how David Lynch
            came up with the character of Bob in Twin Peaks…the story goes that
            Lynch saw the face of his set decorator reflected in a mirror, all
            of a sudden. His face was so creepy and Lynch decided to write a
            part for this guy. Et voila, Bob was born – perhaps the single most
            intriguing character of the show, and he wasn't even in the original
            script! I wanted an album full of these coincidental findings – the
            electricity in the air. And it worked. We couldn't envision the
            album would sound like this beforehand, but we let our gut-feeling
            and our ears guide us!
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>LETV:</b> Great analogy! I’ve always loved that story about Twin
            Peaks. Seems Lynch is a master at keeping the creation process
            open-ended, as a way of inviting in such “happy accidents”. Sounds
            like the demos provided a blueprint to follow but a good deal of
            improvisation and creative back-and-forth really helped flesh these
            songs out. What was that process like? Are these musicians you’ve
            worked with before or was this a new experience? Also, did this
            happen in the studio as you were recording the tracks?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>TW:</b> Exactly, happy accidents, that’s what this album is all
            about. The first musician I contacted was Christophe, the drummer.
            He’s a very free player, inspired by drummers like Tony Allen and
            has a style faraway from mine (I’m much more punky and
            straightforward.) The English author Julian Barnes writes that:
            “When you put together two things that have not been put together
            before, the world is changed”. That was what I was after: looking
            for a new sound by putting together musicians and styles that have
            not been put together before. Christophe got me in touch with two
            other excellent musicians because I literally didn’t know any bass
            players or guitar players - in Little Trouble Kids, we never needed
            any other musicians. The demos did, indeed, provide a blueprint. We
            started rehearsing with the four of us. The musicians started
            interpreting the songs and putting their feelings and emotions into
            the music. But the big work was done in the studio. Pascal Deweze,
            our producer, had a big role in this process. Usually, we just
            played our songs, listened back in the control room, and tried
            another take. Pascal wouldn’t say a thing when we were on the right
            track. But when he felt we were losing our mojo, or if our
            arrangements missed target, he stopped us and provided some new
            ideas that we could again start digging in. For instance, “Hurry
            Man” didn’t really come together. We were trying to make a really
            complicated Radiohead-track. But Pascal stopped us, and said, “Don’t
            try to be like Radiohead. Try to listen to the song, and play only
            what the song needs”. That comment really made it come together, and
            we decided to play it as simple as possible. Janko detuned his
            guitar and discovered the perfect noise with which to bury my voice,
            Christophe decided to play his drums with brushes, and the pieces of
            the puzzle finally fit. It wasn’t Radiohead, it was KRANKLAND!
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>LETV:</b> I’m curious, since you mention other artists like David
            Lynch and Julian Barnes, how much of the original impetus for these
            songs is inspired by art outside the realm of music. Or is it more
            of a musical idea that drives you to start creating in the
            beginning?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>TW:</b> In fact, a lot is inspired by influences outside of the
            realm of music. I find if you’re too consciously referencing other
            bands, the music starts to turn into copycat music. I want to create
            my own universe. Other forms of art are much more productive for me
            since they are much more emotional influences than literal
            influences. One of those names I referenced in writing the music was
            Henry Darger, a fantastic outsider artist who draws weird innocent
            girl-like figures in a violent universe. Another early influence was
            the work by Belgian painter Thierry de Cordier, especially his
            pieces about the sea. It’s a very dark, emotional series, but very
            imaginative and inspiring. So, ‘weird’, ‘innocence’, ‘violence’,
            ‘darkness’, ’emotional’ were the key words I drew from their work.
            They were the building blocks for my own musical universe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whenever I did have musical references, I tried not to look in the
            most obvious places. One big inspiration was the music of Arvo
            P&auml;rt. I adore the frugality and the celestial overtones in his
            work, and his ability to evoke the sublime with very few notes. But
            obviously, KRANKLAND is not “the Belgian answer to Arvo P&auml;rt”.
            But, I’ve tried to put the emotions I get from his work in my own
            music.

          <p>
            <b>LETV:</b> I’m familiar with Henry Darger having grown up in
            Chicago, but Thierry de Cordier and Arvo P&auml;rt are new reference
            points for me! I appreciate that you organized the album around a
            constellation of key words, and could see how this would help focus
            the creative process. We’ve talked some about the “music” part of
            things. How about the lyrics. When do you write the lyrics? Before,
            during, after the music? I would imagine the keywords are again
            quite helpful in this?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>TW:</b> So nice that you are familiar with the work of Henry
            Darger! I got to know his work through my favorite museum in Ghent,
            Museum Dr. Ghuislain, a museum on the origins of psychiatry and
            outsider art.
          </p>

          <p>
            Writing good lyrics was a very important challenge. I wanted to see
            how far my skills as a songwriter could take me in that respect.
            Most of the lyrics were written in dialogue with the music. I have
            read a lot on how Leonard Cohen, Neil Young, Nick Cave and Bob Dylan
            write their lyrics. And apparently they all, to some degree, cherish
            the unconscious when writing lyrics. In fact, they all talk about
            writing lyrics as a kind of dialogue between the conscious and the
            unconscious. Or put otherwise: writing lyrics seems to be a constant
            cooperation between the left side and the right side of your brain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many songs were written at night since I suffered from insomnia in
            that period. Usually, when I couldn’t sleep, I went to my little
            music room (a freakishly small room stacked with way too many
            instruments), and started playing guitar and singing some melodies,
            mumbling random syllables, or random words. I recorded these little
            seeds of songs with a small dictaphone. And the next day the real
            work begin: I started to decipher the ideas I had made during the
            night. And I started making sense out of those mumblings–I started
            figuring out what the songs were actually about. That was my method:
            consciously delving into my unconscious.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>LETV:</b> So, the lyrics are integral to your creative process–a
            way to dialogue with the song while inviting the unconscious into
            the conversation. I know those early hours, in the haze between
            sleep and waking is great for that–and it sounds like you turned
            your insomnia into a working method! Now that we’ve touched a bit on
            song writing and the band, can we peek a little further behind the
            curtain and have you tell us about how a particular track came
            together? Speaking of Henry Darger, “In the Realms of the Unreal” is
            one of my favorite cuts on the record. Maybe you can talk a bit
            about that song, or is there a track with a more interesting
            backstory?
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>TW:</b> I have no exact recollections as to when and where I
            wrote “In The Realms of the Unreal”. But, obviously I saw the Henry
            Darger-documentary, and that title really made sense to my own
            feelings at the time–I had just lost my job and was really down and
            out. But, interestingly, the lyrics of the song are also based upon
            La Divina Commedia by Dante Alighieri. I was raised Catholic, so
            called, like a lot of Belgians or even Europeans are raised
            Catholic. That is, the metaphors and images of the religion are
            totally integrated in our culture and our speech, but we do not
            actively believe in the Christian God–and are mainly just atheists.
            That said, I’m really fond of Christian metaphors to describe the
            postmodern zeitgeist, and that is basically what that song is about.
            But other songs do have a vivid backstory. “Land of Hope and Sores”
            was the first official KRANKLAND-song. I was driving in my car on a
            very dark highway, and suddenly I started singing and playing around
            with some melodies and words. When I came home, I took my guitar and
            put chords underneath the melody. I instantly thought: this is not a
            LTK-song, this calls for a new band, a new project, a new universe.
            I also recall how I wrote the main idea from “Dog Days” when I was
            sitting in a cabin in the woods, totally snowed in. I looked outside
            the window while I was playing guitar and I only saw snow and trees,
            and suddenly the chorus came out! And “Summer Avalanche” is a weird
            story. I heard a song from another Belgian band on the radio, and I
            was so jealous as to how good it was. I wanted to write something
            that was equally catchy and solid. The song is a bit the odd one out
            on the album. But the melody was so inescapable that we had to put
            it on the album. “Capricorn Blues” is also different from the rest,
            in that I wrote it when I was nineteen. Somehow, the song popped its
            head up again when the KRANKLAND-universe was born ten years after
            its first conception.

            <b>LETV:</b> OK, let’s shift gears a bit and talk about things from
            the visual side. You already have two music videos for the KRANKLAND
            tracks “In the Realms of the Unreal” and “Summer Avalanche“–and they
            are quite different from a production standpoint. How important are
            music videos in presenting the band’s creative vision? Is it just an
            afterthought, or is it another important way of conveying your
            vision? I know bands look at it differently and for some, it’s quite
            important, and for others, it’s something they feel compelled to do
            from a marketing standpoint. What can you tell us about the
            production of the videos you’ve done so far for the album? Are there
            more videos coming?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>TW:</b> Videos are extremely important: they contribute to the
            imagination of the KRANKLAND-universe. Aside from the artwork of the
            album (equally important!), they’re the closest you can get to see
            how that world looks inside my head. Or differently put: they are my
            laboratory to create a visual side to the musical universe. “In the
            Realms of the Unreal” was a very low-budget, lo-fi production. I
            looked around for rights-free videos and stumbled upon these really
            cool seventies advertising videos, and they magically clicked with
            the music. This dark figure haunting the streets, and bringing light
            to the mindless inhabitants of a nameless city–it’s something that
            could happen in Krankland!

            But, for “Summer Avalanche”, I wanted something completely different
            because that song is also something else. I wanted to capture the
            spirit of a very hot summer of love, the boredom, the teenage lust.
            It’s not a lo-fi song, so the video had to be filmed professionally.
            Luckily, I found two amazing directors: Kim & Kristof. Two of the
            sweetest people who felt what the song was about, instantly. After a
            few brainstorms, I just gave them carte blanche to do what they
            wanted to do.

            There will definitely be other videos. We’re working on a new one
            for a very intimate song, and I’m planning a few more videos as we
            speak. It will be a very different visual style once again.
            Wanderrooms, the title of the album, is derived from the German word
            Wunderkammer. Weird collections out of the Renaissance. That’s the
            crux of this album: these songs are the result of every influence I
            ever soaked up in my music listening years. Each song is like an
            object in my very own cabinet of curiosities. They are all somewhat
            different songs, but bringing them all together makes sense in my
            head–like those collectors in the old days made really unique
            collections.

            <b>LETV:</b> Thanks Thomas for taking time to answer questions about
            KRANKLAND! To wrap up, what’s next for the band? Touring, recording…
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>TW:</b> We are currently touring in Belgium and the Netherlands,
            and we hope to go further and travel through Europe as well in 2017.
            But, who will tell how far we can go? The first reviews are very
            positive, it could be that we’re only at the beginning of this
            Wanderrooms campaign. I’m already working on new material, and I
            have a feeling that we won’t wait too long to release new material.
            And, there are also some different projects coming up: one involving
            outsider music, and one involving the commemoration of the First
            World War. This adventure has only just begun!
