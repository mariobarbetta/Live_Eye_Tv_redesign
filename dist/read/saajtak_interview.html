          <p>
            Today we catch up with the Detroit-based four-piece
            <a href="https://saajtak.com/" target="_blank">saajtak</a>. The band
            met while studying at the University of Michigan, and formed in
            2014, it includes vocalist <b>Alex Koi</b>, electronic musician
            <b>Simon Alexander-Adams</b>, bassist <b>Ben Willis</b>, and drummer
            <b>Jon Taylor</b>. Combining elements of avant-pop, electronic
            music, jazz, tragic opera–with aspects of prog and punk rock thrown
            in for good measure–<b>saajtak</b> has self-released several EPs
            including 2018’s <i>“Hectic“</i>, 2017’s <i>“Spokes“</i>, and their
            2016 debut <i>“spectral [drips]“</i>. While the band’s members come
            from diverse musical backgrounds, the importance of improvisation is
            central to their approach–even as they amass a more stable body of
            compositional work. Currently writing music for their debut LP while
            getting ready to launch a ten day East Coast tour later this month,
            <b>saajtak</b> took time this month to answer some questions about
            how the band came together, their artistic influences, as well as
            the importance of improvisation to their creative process.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>LETV:</b> Hello <b>saajtak</b>. Thank you for taking some time to
            answer questions about your music. Before we delve into some
            specifics about your creative process, can you talk about how the
            band met and began playing together?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>BW:</b> We all met in Ann Arbor, MI, where we were students at
            University of Michigan. While our musical studies varied widely,
            from jazz, to classical, to electronic and multimedia work, what
            brought us together was our shared affinity for improvisation. We
            all played together in many different groups before this quartet
            coalesced into a lasting project.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>AK:</b> We rather organically developed into a 'band' in the
            sense of having consistent momentum with rehearsals and
            performances. One of the things I love about this project is that I
            think it satisfies an important part of each of our creative
            pallets, but also fuels our other creative endeavors outside of the
            group. It's a good territory of balance to exist in together, which
            is why I think we've seen so much growth and sustainability.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>LETV:</b> saajtak’s music is very intricate and often has an
            amazing amount of detail packed into each composition. What is it
            like to write music for the band and is there a song you can take us
            through that might be emblematic of the process?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>SAA:</b> A lot of our music began as improvisations. We record
            all of our rehearsals for both the purpose of capturing these
            improvisations and workshopping song ideas over time. Usually, the
            detail comes after we have defined a structure for the piece, and
            had time to explore it through successive rehearsals and
            performance. It really is an iterative process, and one where we are
            all responsible for refining our individual parts. While we might
            give each other thoughts or suggestions throughout the process, at
            the end of the day we all choose what to play in a given song.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>“If You Ask”</i> is a good example – it actually existed as two
            ideas for a while before we connected them. We had been playing
            around with the rhythmic patterns in the intro, and the melody in
            the middle for a few rehearsals before we tried putting them
            together. Usually, the transitions are what takes the most work,
            especially when moving between contrasting sections. It's important
            to us that transitions feel natural, and this can take a while to
            get right.
          </p>

            alt="saajtak"
          />
          <p>
            <b>LETV:</b> With improvisation being so important to the band’s
            process, what is the relationship between the band’s recorded
            material and your live performances? How do those two aspects
            intersect?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>BW:</b> For many of our pieces, they evolve very gradually over
            many months, or even years, before they feel like a finished piece.
            The live performance of our music, the energy that we receive from
            an audience, and between us in performance gives us a valuable
            perspective on where we should take things compositionally.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>JT:</b> There's definitely an ongoing dialogue between the two
            spaces. Ultimately we want the music to feel vital, which means we
            have to put fresh energy into every performance. It's easy to get
            locked into a fixed arrangement after recording a song, especially
            after listening to the same version hundreds of times. That runs
            counter to our instincts as improvisers and can drag us down on
            stage. As soon as something feels stagnant we have to go back to the
            drawing board and figure out how and where to infuse new life.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>LETV:</b> For the improvisation to happen well, what important
            traits and abilities should a band’s members possess? It seems quite
            difficult!
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>JT:</b> Trust, personal rapport, presence and flexibility are
            indispensable. Being aware of all the sonic subtleties and making
            strong decisions, and then being willing to shift roles based on the
            changing landscape of the music allow for an organic and
            communicative experience. We all participate in various projects,
            often with no written or predetermined material, that depend on this
            level of love and awareness in order to keep the music from losing
            momentum. I think, at least in our rehearsals, we occupy a middle
            ground where we improvise with that same spontaneous creative
            energy, but also are conscious of part-writing and searching for
            ideas that will make up a compelling song.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>LETV:</b> The band’s music often seems to follow an intriguing
            narrative arc. Is this conscious or does it seem to arise out of
            your experience of playing together while composing?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>BW:</b> I think we all like music that is repetitive and
            trancelike, but also music that has extreme contrasts and widely
            different emotive spaces. For me, working out our compositions is
            sometimes a struggle between feeling like ideas have had enough
            space to settle, and finding an emotive variety.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>SAA:</b> Our narrative arcs are also a result of our process. Our
            process lends itself well to longer episodic forms that dip into
            many musical spaces and ideas. The compositional process is a give
            and take between playing freely and structuring improvised material.
            In this way, we are working to remain conscious during the process
            of improvisation.

            ></iframe
          >

          <p>
            <b>LETV:</b> As far your recorded music is concerned, what is that
            process like for the band? Is there a particular place you like to
            record? I noticed that both <i>“Hectic”</i> and <i>“Spokes”</i> were
            recorded by <b>Adam Cox</b>. How does that relationship contribute
            to the band’s recordings?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>BW:</b> Recording the <i>“Hectic”</i> EP with Adam was a breeze
            because he knew our sound and setup so well from recording us the
            year before. Adam is such a talented and creative musician in his
            own projects, as well as being a great engineer. Building
            collaborative relationships is an important part of how we like to
            work.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>JT:</b> We always record live and in the same space so that we
            can capture the communicative energy we depend at our shows. From
            there we can overdub as needed and shape and produce it so it sounds
            polished and whole. Getting that initial live core is key, though,
            and Adam knows exactly how to do that.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>LETV:</b> saajtak’s music definitely seems to draw from a lot of
            different influences. Can you talk about what inspires the band from
            a sonic as well as artistic perspective?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>AK:</b> Some people call us rock, some people call us avantpop,
            others call us jazz and occasionally we get "really-out" opera.
            Statements like these are probably most indicative of our
            influences. Some shared favorites are Meredith Monk, Brian Eno,
            clipping., Amon Tobin, Bjork, and Kate Bush. We recently each made a
            list of ten albums we wanted to use as guiding principles for
            saajtak and there was quite a lot of overlap! We may be slightly
            morphing into one another over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>LETV:</b> This year you released a new EP via Bandcamp called
            <i>“Hectic”</i>. It’s your third release. How has the band grown and
            changed since your first improvised release, “Spectral [drips]” back
            in 2016?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>BW:</b> In earlier shows, we did a lot more improvising freely in
            live sets. That has shifted over the years, partly because we've
            developed more composed material to play, and this band is our way
            of presenting that. We all continue to improvise together in other
            contexts. Lately, we have been making space in our live sets to
            improvise more. Ultimately this band is the resulting voice of the
            four of us, more than it is a projected idea of what we should sound
            like.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>LETV:</b> What’s next for the band? Do you have some new
            recordings that you’re working on? How about touring plans?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>AK:</b> We're in a writing stage currently with about three songs
            almost completed, and a bunch more in the works. Gearing up for our
            debut full length and maybe some smaller releases beforehand. We're
            doing a 10-day tour this October to the East coast as well.
