                    The Seattle dance-punk outfit <a href="https://www.wearethegodsthemselves.com/" target="_blank">
                        The Gods Themselves</a> returned this May with a new LP entitled <i>New Excuse</i>. The group,
                    led by the songwriting duo of <b>Astra Elane</b> (vocals, guitar) and <b>Dustin Patterson</b>
                    (vocals, baritone), gained success with their track <i>“Tech Boys,”</i> off the band’s 2017
                    self-released LP <i>Be My Animal</i>, before reaching national attention with an appearance on
                    <b>Anthony Bourdain</b>’s Parts Unknown series.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Following up on those accomplishments, TGT’s new album was recorded with famed producer <b>Stephen
                        Hague</b>,
                    responsible for synth-pop hits like <b>Pet Shop Boys</b> <i>“West End Girls,”</i> <b>New Order</b>s
                    <i>“True Faith”</i> and <i>“Regret,”</i> as well as <b>Siouxsie and the Banshees</b>‘ <i></i>“Kiss
                    Them For
                    Me,”</b> to name a just few. This week Live Eye Tv had a chance to catch up with Astra and Dustin
                    via email to
                    discuss <i>New Excuse</i>, the success of their track <i>“Tech Boys,”</i> and life during
                    quarantine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>LETV:</b> Congratulations on the release of <i>New Excuse</i>! The band’s synth-pop and
                    dance-punk leanings
                    seem perfectly suited for working with a producer like Stephen Hague, whose discography includes
                    production for
                    artists like <b>Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark</b>, <b>Pet Shop Boys</b>, <b>New Order</b>, and
                    <b>Peter
                        Gabriel</b>, to name a few. How did The Gods Themselves come to work with Hague, and how did the
                    experience
                    shape the new record?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Dustin:</b> Stephen represented a sound and aesthetic that we all loved. And luckily he loved us
                    back. He
                    was friendly and funny, but had strong ideas about the songs. He contributed a lot to the
                    arrangements, tones,
                    and overall sound of the album. In some cases, we re-wrote lyrics or hooks at his suggestion. It was
                    a total
                    collaboration. We were focused on making the best album we could make. We wanted a big polished
                    sound and he
                    certainly delivered. It’s the best sounding album we’ve made.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Astra:</b> After self-producing all of our previous albums we decided we wanted to take things to
                    the next
                    level and learn from a master. We reached out to Stephen Hague’s manager with our fingers crossed
                    and it turned
                    out that he really liked our demos! The end result comprises arrangements that we would never have
                    thought of
                    as well as tones and techniques. It was incredible working with him. Stephen was very cognizant of
                    our already
                    defined sound only improved on it. Here’s a quote directly from him:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <i>
                        “It’s not everyday that I hear demos and say to myself ’I have to make this record’, but their
                        songs and
                        chemistry together are a potent combination, and I always know the real thing when I hear it.
                        I’m lucky to
                        play a part in the next Seattle wave, as led by TGT…surf’s up! “
                    </i>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    <b>LETV:</b> As far as songwriting on the album is concerned, and how a song evolves and comes into
                    being, is
                    there a track you might take us through so as to demonstrate your process?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Astra:</b> The songs start as a sketch by either Dustin or myself. The sketch could be well
                    defined or just
                    a riff. We then bring it into the room and play it with the rhythm section who add their own spin to
                    it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Dustin:</b> Songs usually start when Astra and I bring the band a demo. Then we jam in the room,
                    arranging
                    and reimagining the song with the full group. A good example is “Lovers,” which began as two
                    separate demos that
                    we eventually Frankensteined together in the room. We then jammed on an outro and suddenly we had
                    this new song
                    full of sudden changes. There’s a lot of trial and error with this approach, but it brings life to
                    the demo. It’s
                    rare that our songs won’t significantly change once we get them in the practice space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>LETV:</b> Thematically, the record often seems to deal with seeking that electric charge of
                    connection that
                    can happen between people or longing for it. There’s something very physical and intimate about the
                    music and its
                    concerns. Can you talk about some of the thematic influences behind New Excuse?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Dustin:</b> I think this album, for whatever reason, was inspired by sex and longing. We tend to
                    dress up and
                    act provocatively onstage so the music had to suit the presentation to a degree. And dance music is
                    very much
                    about the body, so it fits that the lyrics are similarly obsessed. I know we were all striving,
                    struggling and
                    longing when we made the album so it definitely infused itself into the music.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Astra:</b> Yes, sex and longing. All of our songs are written from the perspective of an
                    experience or a
                    feeling we wanted to convey. Sharing that feeling as authentically as we can hopefully foster that
                    intimacy.
                </p>
                <img src="../images/the-gods-themselves-1-post.jpg" class="small-image" alt="The Gods Themselves">
                <p>
                    <b>LETV:</b> While much of the current record was probably written and recorded before the global
                    pandemic
                    and quarantine, was the band anxious at all about releasing the album under current conditions, or
                    did it seem
                    more necessary? Does the album bear any new light for you considering the times?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Astra:</b> The album came out as planned but everything else has been put on hold, the big
                    release party,
                    the tour, and summer gigs. What a drag. I don’t think there was ever a doubt about putting the music
                    out on
                    time. It did feel necessary, both for folks to hear it and for us to move on and have closure to the
                    creation
                    of the album.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Dustin:</b> This is an interesting time to release a record. On the one hand, it’s a hard time
                    for everyone,
                    particularly our friends in the music business. On the other hand, we have a captive audience that’s
                    in need of
                    entertainment. I’ve been pleased by the reception. My mom loves it. “Very professional.” The closing
                    song,
                    “Magick,” has an extra resonance now. It’s about loving in the face of everything ending. It always
                    felt like
                    the perfect closer, but now it feels even more apocalyptic and defiant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>LETV:</b> The Gods Themselves have always seemed to enjoy local success here in Seattle, but your
                    segment
                    with Anthony Bourdain on Parts Unknown and your track “Tech Boys” really opened you up to a larger,
                    international
                    audience. What can you tell us about that song and how it led to appearing on the show?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Dustin:</b> I was working at Amazon and really displeased by its culture of mistreatment. I would
                    come into
                    the practice space overwhelmed by rage. “Tech Boys” was me focusing that rage into a song. I knew we
                    had something
                    special when someone down the hall from our space knocked on the door to tell us he liked it. That
                    never happens.
                    Once we made the video, Bourdain’s production team reached out and of course we said yes. They were
                    all a dream to
                    work with, very professional, funny and relaxed. Bourdain himself was very generous with his time
                    and very candid
                    about his life. It was heartbreaking when he killed himself. He’s someone you feel very close to
                    right away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Astra:</b> It’s a damn catchy song and so relevant. We got a lot of hits on it and somehow the
                    buzz reached New
                    York. I was in disbelief when the production company sent us an e-mail. I had to keep re-reading it.
                </p>

                    <b>LETV:</b> While all cities go through their ups and downs, Seattle’s tech boom has often made it
                    too expensive
                    for many artists to live. Unfortunately, that can take a real toll on a city’s creative life. By the
                    same token,
                    it is easy to fall into the trap of thinking “everything was so much cooler” back when…If
                    gentrification has
                    narrowed opportunities for artistic expression, how do we fight back? Or more particularly, how have
                    The Gods
                    Themselves fought back?

                    <b>Dustin:</b> The indisputable fact is: it WAS cooler back then. Slower, quieter, weirder,
                    scuzzier, more dangerous,
                    MUCH cheaper. It had personality. Now that’s been almost entirely erased by a corporate
                    mono-culture. We fight back
                    by supporting other artists in the community. Arranging bills with bands we love like Bear Axe,
                    Razor Clam, Eric Blood,
                    and others. We shine a light where we can, buy their records, see them at gigs. We band together to
                    stay alive. You
                    have to find your community and do what you can to keep it strong.

                    <b>Astra:</b> Before lockdown we could always play a show whether it was at a venue or a house party
                    or festival. We
                    got really good at putting on our own shows with our other artist friends, putting the bill
                    together, bringing in
                    folks to do light shows, bringing in DJs to play in between sets, etc. Stayin’ scrappy is the way to
                    survive. Where
                    there’s a will, there’s a way, until there’s a pandemic anyway.

                    <b>LETV:</b> With everything so up in the air as to when people can gather again—let alone see music
                    in a live
                    setting—there’s a lot of reason to be anxious about the state of the music industry? Any reflections
                    at this time, or
                    glimmers of hope?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Dustin:</b> We’ve had pandemics throughout human history. They all pass eventually. But music
                    never stops and it
                    will never go away. It may take a long time, but people are social animals. As soon as this is over,
                    we’ll be playing
                    and dancing louder and longer and closer than ever.

                    <b>Astra:</b> Seeing some folks easily transition to virtual like they were changing their socks or
                    something. Not
                    that easy for me. I vibe off the energy of my band and not being able to play with them sucks. Music
                    is my therapy
                    and I need some soon.

                    <b>LETV:</b> Many musicians and labels have responded to quarantine by live streaming performances.
                    This has led to
                    all kinds of amazing events like Nick Cave’s 24-hour live performance stream on YouTube for instance
                    or the chance
                    to see inside a favorite artist’s bedroom or practice space. Have you folks enjoyed any live streams
                    during this
                    period? Do you find it a satisfying answer considering the circumstances, and does the band have any
                    live streaming
                    events planned?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Dustin:</b> I’ve seen some good ones. The Nick Cave stream. I’m turning more to comedy podcasts
                    to get me thru.
                    Things like We Hate Movies, SuperEgo, Conan O’Brien Needs A Friend. We’re considering something for
                    sure. Stay tuned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Astra:</b> No streams right now but soon. Atm we’re working on videos, another part of the
                    creative process which
                    is also fun. Also, thank god we live in the golden age of television.
