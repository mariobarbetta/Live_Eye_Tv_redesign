            The Portland-based band
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Meltmeltmelt666/" target="_blank"
              >Melt</a
            >
            is readying their new LP <i>Sour Fruit</i> for release on June 30th
            via
            <a href="https://halfshellrecords.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank"
              >Halfshell Records</a
            >. Formed back in 2014 by singer/guitarist <b>Jeff Boyardee</b>, he
            has remained the project’s core member thru the years. Joined by an
            often rotating cast of fellow Portland musicians, Melt’s previous
            releases include the 2017 LP <i>Pick A Fight</i> and the 2016 EP
            <i>Black Gold</i>. Boyardee’s upcoming effort was recorded by
            <b>Cameron Spies</b> at <b>Gold Brick Studios</b> and it finds Melt
            further expanding on their quirky, garage-driven psych-pop. Live Eye
            Tv recently caught up with the singer/guitarist to discuss the
            project and new album. Check out the email conversation below…
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>LETV:</b> Congratulations on the new album <i>Sour Fruit</i>!
            Before we delve into the record can you tell us a bit about how Melt
            initially came together back in 2014? Also, while the band has core
            members, the line-up seems to have changed slightly thru the years.
            How did the band's current iteration come together?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>JB:</b> It's weird. Melt initially started as a side project of
            mine and I pulled other friends and musicians from their main
            projects as well. It kind of started as a melting pot, and certainly
            had a good deal of the naming of the project. As far as original
            core members, it's really just me. Life happens, people dip in and
            out. People can't commit to tour life, main projects take precedent,
            and sometimes people just don't work well. I think at this point
            we've had 8 people including myself, formally, a part of the band in
            some iteration. Same goes with who's still here. Some people have
            the time, can commit, and to be honest, give a shit. It's hard to
            find a good crew of people to create and perform with but when it
            works, it works.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>LETV:</b> <i>Sour Fruit</i> was recorded by
            <b>Cameron Spies</b> at <b>Gold Brick Studios</b>. Is it fair to say
            that your previous albums, the LP <i>Pick A Fight</i> and the EP
            <i>Black Gold</i>, were more home recorded affairs than the new
            effort? How was the process different than previous records?
            Additionally, it looks like it took some time to get
            <i>Sour Fruit</i> recorded. Was that a matter of happenstance or
            more of an intentional part of the process?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>JB:</b> The short and honest answer is we're not made of money
            and unfortunately playing small clubs, houses, and generally touring
            DIY style isn't lucrative; and that's not our goal either, it is
            also a labor of love. But that isn't free, hahaha. Also, life
            happens.
          </p>
          <p>
            After we finished all the basic tracking, I went off to tour manage
            two different bands over three months. We get busy. Working with
            Cameron was a blessing and a very eye-opening process in reflection.
            <i>Pick a Fight</i> was recorded between the moonbase and the house
            of a couple of ourselves. <i>Black Gold</i> was recorded in a good
            friend’s home studio. The biggest difference I would say that sets
            <i>Sour Fruit</i> apart from the others is extra attention to detail
            and songwriting. Couldn't have asked for a better recording
            experience or better producer for us than with Cameron.

          <p>
            <b>LETV:</b> Curious to know more about the band's songwriting for
            the new album…
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>JB:</b> Originally this release was meant to be a full debut
            album vs. another EP. In the end, we actually split it in half and
            determined they belonged separate. We started with 18 songs and
            landed on 14 divided by 2 is 7.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>LETV:</b> Lots of great visuals for the new record including the
            cover and video for the album track <i>Strange Fruit</i>. What can
            you tell us about the production for the video and how did the album
            cover come together?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>JB:</b> Believe it or not the video and cover shoot were
            conceptualized separately–the video by <b>Peter Karavias</b>, the
            cover shot by <b>Keanu Narciso</b>. The only similarity is the fact
            that we based everything on the title track. They came to the final
            result almost completely on their own volition.

          <p>
            <b>LETV:</b> From the outside looking in it seems as though Portland
            has a very creative and supportive music scene going on right now.
            What can you tell us about making music in the city currently?
            Living there, does it feel as creative and lively as it does from
            the outside?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>JB:</b> It comes in waves, and it does feel like it’s at a high
            at the moment. Some good friends of ours are writing some of the
            best records we've heard in quite a bit and couldn’t be more proud
            to be apart of the city. It's a fluid that changes quickly and
            frequently.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>LETV:</b> What's next for Melt? Do you guys have a tour planned
            for this summer and will you be making it up to Seattle soon?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>JB:</b> TWe are about to head out on a US tour in less than a
            month. We'll be in Seattle 6/28 (release day), actually, as well.
            And like I said, the other half of this release is primed and ready
            to go. Expect the darker, heavier side in the fall/winter.
