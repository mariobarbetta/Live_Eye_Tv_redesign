              Halfshell Records</a
            >
            this month. Formed by drummer <b>Papi Fimbres</b> and guitarist
            <b>Charles Salas-Humara</b> after their previous band
            <b>Sun Angle</b> went on hiatus, the improvisational duo quickly
            sought roots by adding guitarist/vocalist <b>Elaina Tardif</b> and
            bassist/vocalist <b>Rebecca Rasmussen</b>.
          </p>

          <p>
            On their debut effort, the group combines their post-punk leanings
            with touches of psych and shoegaze making for propulsive and
            hypnotic music. Coupled with soaring vocal harmonies, this is one of
            those hard to classify gems you might stumble upon at your favorite
            record store. Not quite sure what you have in your hands, you go
            home to find your gamble has paid off in sonic gold.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wet Fruit recently took time to discuss how the band came together,
            as well as the release of their new cassette. Band members took
            turns answering questions via email correspondence and what follows
            is a transcript of our conversation…
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>LETV:</b> Congratulations on the upcoming release of your
            self-titled debut album. Before we delve into the record and how it
            came together, what can you tell us about the formation of Wet
            Fruit? You folks all seem to be involved in a multitude of projects,
            so I’m curious how this particular group met and began playing
            together…
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>PF:</b> Good question and thank you! So, Charlie Salas-Humara and
            I wanted to start a new band after our previous band, Sun Angle,
            went on hiatus; and it was originally a two-piece (guitars & drums &
            weird noises) that was all completely improvisational music, on the
            spot. After our initial debut show, homies were really into it and
            we wanted to have a focal point on the music and not be so chaotic,
            so we added Elaina Tardif on guitar and vocals and started writing
            songs (some of them are on this album of the original two-piece
            incarnation). They were sounding pretty fucking killer but we
            quickly realized we needed a bassist. In comes Rebecca Rasmussen and
            with her, her amazingly beautiful vocals and a plethora of new song
            ideas. Now everyone sings, except for me, of course.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>LETV:</b> Let’s talk about songwriting. The band has a very
            inventive style that seems capable of changing on a dime from
            harmonized melodies to freaked-out meltdown, and the band mentions
            “controlled chaos” as a compositional device. From a songwriting
            perspective, how do you juggle these various urges? Is there a song
            on the album you might take us through to describe this process?
            Additionally, where does the writing of lyrics fit in?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>RR:</b> This album was written with some songs partially formed
            from Charlie and Papi’s first version of Wet Fruit. After bringing
            Elaina in and eventually myself on bass, we continued throwing
            everything out there and captured the parts that worked. Kind of a
            free jazz, all-over-the-place approach, then arrange and hone later.
          </p>
          <p>
            A lot of this album we worked out in the live setting. We ended up
            playing several shows where we didn’t even have finalized
            lyrics/melodies for most of the songs. That element finally came
            into place in the studio with various people writing lyrics or even
            parts of lyrics for ourselves and for each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’d say the doubleheader <i>“Wasted Future”</i> into
            <i>“Relaxed Trucker”</i> is a good example of “changing on a dime.”
            Again, it’s a combination of something that had elements that were
            fully formed but we added parts that were worked out live and also
            in the studio almost by accident–or one could say by feel. A kind of
            smooshing of opposing forces and seeing if we could meld that into
            something wonderful. The freak out meltdowns… well, we’ll just say
            we all have a part of that in us and it just comes out inevitably.
          </p>

          />
          <p>
            <b>LETV:</b> What was it like recording Wet Fruit? There’s an
            intricacy to the sound as far as the interplay between guitars,
            vocals, etc., as well as shifts in dynamics that I would imagine
            present some sonic challenges. Who recorded the album and where? How
            involved in production was the band?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>CS-H:</b> We recorded with Johann Wagner at Pinewave studios out
            in the woods and did it all live except for vocals and some keys. We
            worked hard getting the call and response guitars and bass parts
            tight before we showed up and let Johann add whatever he thought
            effects-wise. The vocal interplay between Elaina and Rebecca was
            experimented with and perfected in the studio.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>LETV:</b> How did the band hook up with Halfshell Records? Was it
            important to establish a relationship with a label, and if so, why?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>PF:</b> I initially played a show with Daniel from Halfshell with
            my other band Máscaras, in Seattle (where the label is based out of)
            at Barboza; and we had such a killer, stoned out of my mind night
            and remember thinking to myself, “this dude rules, gotta remember
            him.” Fast forward to a year or so down the life road, I saw some
            local homies release a tape in Portland via Halfshell Records, and I
            was like, “Who is this label?! They have so many of our homies on
            that label!” I emailed them and Daniel was on the other end of the
            line, being like “Dude!” So, here we are now and it’s been such an
            easy breezy blast working with Halfshell.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>LETV:</b> While the internet and social media have changed so
            much about how a band can reach an audience these days, in many
            ways, it’s not much different from punk’s DIY approach. Do you find
            that tools like social media and platforms like Bandcamp, Spotify,
            etc.make it easier to reach an audience? Are they creatively and
            emotionally satisfying to use?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>ET:</b> We waited quite a while before making any kind of
            official Wet Fruit profile, and then stuck to Instagram exclusively
            for about a year. Still avoiding making a Facebook page for now
            (we’ll see how long that lasts). Social media is potentially a great
            tool for DIY efforts, but it’s so easy to get lost in the digital
            maze, or feel obligated to generate meaningless content in an
            attempt to stay “relevant.”
          </p>
          <p>
            That said, it’s currently the most convenient way to reach our
            audience and connect with other bands/bookers. Spotify seems rather
            sinister in terms of how musicians end up getting paid next to
            nothing, but it’s honestly my go-to for discovering new music and
            making playlists that are easy to share with friends. I’m the baby
            of the band and never knew the days of mailing tapes to venues in
            other cities, booking nation wide tours with a phone book and a
            prayer.
          </p>
          <p>
            From what I can tell, the internet has made promotion much faster
            and cheaper, but simultaneously more competitive. Creatively, it’s
            pretty limiting as you have to work within a universal framework
            that presents its own challenges. But that was true about radio!
            It’s been 113 years since the first song was broadcast over the
            airwaves. Who knows, maybe Instagram will be viewed 100 years from
            now as one last big party before the singularity hit;)
          </p>
          <img
            class="image-right"
            src="../images/wet-fruit-band-photo-2-post.jpg"
          />
          <p>
            <b>LETV:</b> Portland currently seems to have a very vibrant music
            and arts scene. I would suspect, though, that the city will face
            many of the challenges that Seattle has faced over the last twenty
            years as it grows. Here, the influx of corporations has made the
            city unaffordable for musicians and artists. Unfortunately, that
            takes a toll on a creative scene. Where is Portland in this process?
            Does it feel like the city is on a creative upswing currently, or is
            that just easy to project in a “grass is always greener…” sort of
            way?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>ET & RR:</b> Portland has definitely drawn creatives because of
            its affordability in the past. We’ve seen a lot of people either
            move to LA or NYC to pursue what seems to be the next level of
            success because while Portland is vibrant it is also easy to get
            comfortable and complacent. Also, we have seen a large number of
            people just leave. Yes, because of rising prices, but also because
            the grit that used to exist (ie. house shows and smaller punk
            venues, generator shows under the freeway, etc…) have been next to
            wiped out.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, people are still here fighting the good fight! The American
            Legion (Post 134), the Waypost, and Blackwater, amongst others, are
            pushing for all-ages shows despite the city regulations making it
            difficult for places to host all-ages shows. Record stores like
            Specks and vintage stores like Zero Wave have several shows a month.
            Seems like every few weeks a venue closes or a bar decides to stop
            booking shows, but new spots are popping up.
          </p>
          <p>
            People are trying to make sure it doesn’t disappear. There’s a good
            amount of mid-sized venues that are pretty well established, but
            it’s the smaller ones that are needed to sustain a more experimental
            scene and make space for new artists. Is the grass greener? It’s all
            relative.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>LETV:</b> What’s next for the band after the release of your
            debut. Do you guys have a tour or local shows planned? How about a
            music video?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Wet Fruit:</b> We’ve got a music video ready to share and we’re
            already working on a new album! Winter will be dedicated to that
            endeavor, as well as curating a few special shows in Portland and
            around the Northwest. In spring, we will be playing Tree Fort and
            want to fit some more tour dates around that…
